<h1> MICROSOFT WINDOWS</h1>
<p class=par_main>Microsoft Windows, commonly referred to as Windows,is an operating system used by 76.45% of Desktop<br> PCs and laptops.It is developed and owned by Microsoft.
Microsoft introduced Windows on November 20,<br> 1985,as a graphical operating system and an upgrade from <a href= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS target=blank_>MS-DOS</a>(which was c ommand-line only OS). </p><img src=375px-Windows_darkblue_2012.svg.png align=right style="position: absolute; top: 150px; right: 20px;"; ></img>

<h1 class=vh>Version History</h1>
<h2> Early versions</h2>
<h3><a href=https://winworldpc.com/product/windows-10/101 target=blank_>Windows 1.0</a></h3>
<p class=par_main> Windows 1.0 was released in November 1985. Windows 1.0 was to compete with Apple's operating system, but achieved little popularity. Windows 1.0 is not a complete operating system; rather, it extends MS-DOS.
Components included Calculator, Calendar, Cardfile, Clipboard Viewer, Clock, Control Panel, Notepad, Paint, Reversi, Terminal and Write. Windows 1.0 does not allow overlapping windows. Instead all windows are tiled. Only modal dialog boxes may appear over other windows.</p><img src=></img>
<img src=Windows1.0.png align=center></img>
<h3><a href=https://winworldpc.com/product/windows-20/20 target=blank_>Windows 2.0</a></h3>
<p class=par_main>Windows 2.0 was released in December 1987, and was more popular than its predecessor. It features several improvements to the user interface and memory management. Windows 2.03 changed the OS from tiled windows to overlapping windows. 
The result of this change led to Apple Computer filing a suit against Microsoft alleging infringement on Apple's copyrights. Windows 2.0 also introduced more sophisticated keyboard shortcuts and could make use of expanded memory.
Windows 2.1 was released in two different versions: <a href=https://oldcomputermuseum.com/os/windows_286_v2.10.html target=blank_>Windows/286</a> and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_2.0#Windows/386 target=blank_>Windows/386</a>.
In addition to full Windows-packages, there were runtime-only versions that shipped with early Windows software from third parties and made it possible to run their Windows software on MS-DOS and without the full Windows feature set.</p>

<h2><a href=https://winworldpc.com/product/windows-3/30 target=blank_>Windows 3.x</a></h2>
<h3>Windows 3.0</h3>
<p class=par_main>Windows 3.0, released in 1990, improved the design, mostly because of virtual memory and loadable virtual device drivers (VxDs) that allow Windows to share arbitrary devices between multi-tasked DOS applications.
 Windows 3.0 also featured improvements to the user interface. Microsoft rewrote critical operations from <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language) target=blank_>C</a> into <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language target=blank_>assembly</a>. Windows 3.0 is the first Microsoft Windows version to achieve broad commercial success, selling 2 million copies in the first six months.
 Windows 3.1, made generally available on March 1, 1992, featured a facelift. In August 1993, Windows for Workgroups, a special version with integrated peer-to-peer networking features and a version number of 3.11, was released. It was sold along with Windows 3.1. Support for Windows 3.1 ended on December 31, 2001.
 Windows 3.2, released 1994, is an updated version of the Chinese version of Windows 3.1. The update was limited to this language version, as it fixed only issues related to the complex writing system of the Chinese language.</p>

<h2>Windows 9.x</h2>
<h3><a href=https://winworldpc.com/product/windows-95/osr-2 target=blank_>Windows 95</a></h3>
<p class=par_main>The next major consumer-oriented release of Windows, Windows 95, was released on August 24, 1995. While still remaining MS-DOS-based, Windows 95 introduced support for native 32-bit applications, plug and play hardware, preemptive multitasking, long file names of up to 255 characters, and provided increased stability over its predecessors. Windows 95 also introduced a redesigned, object oriented user interface, replacing the previous Program Manager with the Start menu, taskbar, and Windows Explorer shell. 
Windows 95 was a major commercial success for Microsoft; Ina Fried of CNET remarked that "by the time Windows 95 was finally ushered off the market in 2001, it had become a fixture on computer desktops around the world."
Windows 95 was also the first version of Windows to be bundled with Microsoft's web browser, Internet Explorer.Mainstream support for Windows 95 ended on December 31, 2000, and extended support for Windows 95 ended on December 31, 2001.</p>

<h3><a href=https://winworldpc.com/product/windows-98/98-second-edition target=blank_>Windows 98</a></h3>
<p class=par_main>Windows 95 was followed up with the release of Windows 98 on June 25, 1998, which introduced the Windows Driver Model(which is a framework for device drivers), support for USB devices, support for <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Configuration_and_Power_Interface target=blank_>ACPI</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibernation_(computing) target=blank_>hibernation</a>, and support for multi-monitor configurations. Windows 98 also included integration with Internet Explorer 4.
 In May 1999, Microsoft released Windows 98 Second Edition, an updated version of Windows 98. Windows 98 SE added Internet Explorer 5.0 and Windows Media Player 6.2 amongst other upgrades,like improved modem and sound/audio card support through the Windows Driver Model, improved USB support, and others.
 Mainstream support for Windows 98 ended on June 30, 2002, and extended support for Windows 98 ended on July 11, 2006.</p>

 <h3><a href=https://winworldpc.com/product/windows-me/final target=blank_>Windows ME(Millenium Edition)</a></h3>
 <p class=par_main>On September 14, 2000, Microsoft released Windows Me (Millennium Edition), the last DOS-based version of Windows. Windows Me incorporated visual interface enhancements from its Windows NT-based counterpart Windows 2000, had faster boot times than previous versions (which however, required the removal of the ability to access a real mode DOS environment, which removed compatibility with some older programs), expanded multimedia functionality (including Windows Media Player 7, Windows Movie Maker, and the Windows Image Acquisition framework for retrieving images from scanners and digital cameras), additional system utilities such as <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_File_Protection target=blank_>System File Protection</a> and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Restore target=blank_>System Restore</a>, and updated home networking tools. 
 However, Windows Me was faced with criticism for its speed and instability, along with hardware compatibility issues and its removal of real mode DOS support,which caused older programs to not work properly. PC World considered Windows Me to be one of the worst operating systems Microsoft had ever released, and the 4th worst tech product of all time.</p>

<h2> Windows XP </h2>
<p class=par_main>The next major version of Windows, Windows XP, was released on October 25, 2001. The introduction of Windows XP aimed to unify the consumer-oriented Windows 9x series with the architecture introduced by Windows NT, a change which Microsoft promised would provide better performance over its DOS-based predecessors. 
Windows XP would also introduce a redesigned user interface (including an updated Start menu and a "task-oriented" Windows Explorer), streamlined multimedia and networking features, Internet Explorer 6, integration with Microsoft's .NET Passport services, modes to help provide compatibility with software designed for previous versions of Windows, and Remote Assistance functionality.
At retail, Windows XP was now marketed in two main editions: the "Home" edition was targeted towards consumers, while the "Professional" edition was targeted towards business environments and power users, and included additional security and networking features. Home and Professional were later accompanied by the "Media Center" edition (designed for home theater PCs, with an emphasis on support for DVD playback, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_tuner_card target=blank_>TV tuner cards</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_video_recorder target=blank_>DVR</a> functionality and remote controls), and the "Tablet PC" edition (designed for mobile devices, with support for stylus pen input and additional pen-enabled applications). 
Mainstream support for Windows XP ended on April 14, 2009. Extended support ended on April 8, 2014.</p>

<h2> Windows Vista </h2>
<p class=par_main>After a lengthy development process, Windows Vista was released on November 30, 2006, for volume licensing and January 30, 2007, for consumers. It contained a number of new features, from a redesigned shell and user interface to significant technical changes, with a particular focus on security features. 
It was available in a number of different editions, and has been subject to some criticism, such as drop of performance, longer boot time, criticism of new <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Account_Control target=blank_>UAC</a>(User Account Control), and stricter license agreement. Vista's server counterpart, Windows Server 2008 was released in early 2008.
It also introduced the famous "Aero" design theme,which introduces transparent borders on windows,transparent taskbar and start menu and other transparency,glass-like looking elements.</p>

<h2> Windows 7 </h2>
<p class=par_main>On July 22, 2009, Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 were released as RTM (release to manufacturing) while the former was released to the public 3 months later on October 22, 2009. Unlike its predecessor, Windows Vista, which introduced a large number of new features, Windows 7 was intended to be a more focused, incremental upgrade to the Windows line, with the goal of being compatible with applications and hardware with which Windows Vista was already compatible. Windows 7 has multi-touch support, a redesigned Windows shell(Windows user interface) with an updated taskbar, a home networking system called HomeGroup, and performance improvements.</p>

<h2> Windows 8 and 8.1 </h2>
<p class=par_main>Windows 8, the successor to Windows 7, was released generally on October 26, 2012. A number of significant changes were made on Windows 8, including the introduction of a user interface based around Microsoft's <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(design_language) target=blank_>Metro design language</a> with optimizations for touch-based devices such as tablets and all-in-one PCs. 
These changes include the Start screen, which uses large tiles that are more convenient for touch interactions and allow for the display of continually updated information, and a new class of apps which are designed primarily for use on touch-based devices. It also removed the start button from the bottom left corner of the screen(instead,to access the new Start Screen you had to press in the empty corner,which was criticised).
The new Windows version required a minimum resolution of 1024×768 pixels, effectively making it unfit for netbooks with 800×600-pixel screens.
Other changes include increased integration with cloud services and other online platforms (such as social networks and Microsoft's own OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) and Xbox Live services), the Windows Store service for software distribution, and a new variant known as Windows RT for use on devices that utilize the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture target=blank_>ARM architecture.</a>
An update to Windows 8, called Windows 8.1, was released on October 17, 2013, and includes features such as new live tile sizes, deeper OneDrive integration,bringing back the start button and many others. Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 have been subject to some criticism for various things including the removal of the Start menu and the new Start Screen.</p>

<h2>Windows 10</h2>
<p class=par_main>On September 30, 2014, Microsoft announced Windows 10 as the successor to Windows 8.1. It was released on July 29, 2015 and is the latest version of Windows to date(as of 13 February 2021).It addresses shortcomings in the user interface first introduced with Windows 8. Changes on PC include the return of the Start Menu, a virtual desktop system(allowing for multiple desktops), and the ability to run Windows Store apps within windows on the desktop rather than in full-screen mode. 
Windows 10 was available as a free upgrade for 1 year from qualified Windows 7 with SP1, Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 devices from the Get Windows 10 Application (for Windows 7, Windows 8.1) or Windows Update (Windows 7).
Microsoft also decided that this should be the last version number of Windows and that hasn't changed to date. Instead of releasing new versions of Windows every year(Windows 11,12 and so on) they decided to roll out Windows 10 updates in the form of new Versions or Builds which bring new features(for example the latest stable version is Windows 10 2004).Those upgrades are also free of charge(unlike the previous Windows upgrades where you had to buy the new version of Windows.)
This is very similar to how it is on mobile devices.To get the latest version of Windows click the link below.</p>
