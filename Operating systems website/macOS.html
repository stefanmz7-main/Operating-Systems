<h2>What is macOS?</h2>
<p class=par_main>macOS ( previously Mac OS X and later OS X) is a series of proprietary graphical operating systems developed and marketed by Apple Inc. since 2001. It is the primary operating system for Apple's Mac computers. Within the market of desktop, laptop and home computers, and by web usage, it is the second most widely used desktop OS, after Microsoft Windows

macOS adopted the Unix kernel and inherited technologies developed between 1985 and 1997 at NeXT, the company that Apple co-founder Steve Jobs created after leaving Apple in 1985. 

Apple's mobile operating system, iOS, has been considered a variant of macOS.</p>

<div class=div_history style="transform:translate(0px,70px);">
<h2>Version History</h2>
<p class=par_main>The first desktop version, Mac OS X 10.0, was released in March 2001, with its first update, 10.1, arriving later that year. The "X" in Mac OS X and OS X is the Roman numeral for the number 10 and is pronounced as such. The X was a prominent part of the operating system's brand identity and marketing in its early years, but gradually receded in prominence since the release of Snow Leopard in 2009. Apple began naming its releases after big cats, which lasted until OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion. Since OS X 10.9 Mavericks, releases have been named after locations in California.Apple shortened the name to "OS X" in 2012 and then changed it to "macOS" in 2016, adopting the nomenclature that they were using for their other operating systems, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS. With Big Sur, Apple advanced the macOS major version number for the first time, changing it to 11 for Big Sur from the 10 used for all previous releases.</p>

<p class=par_main>As the operating system evolved, it moved away from the classic Mac OS, with applications being added and removed. Considering music to be a key market, Apple developed the iPod music player and music software for the Mac, including iTunes and GarageBand. Targeting the consumer and media markets, Apple emphasized its new "digital lifestyle" applications such as the iLife suite, integrated home entertainment through the Front Row media center and the Safari web browser. With increasing popularity of the internet, Apple offered additional online services, including the .Mac, MobileMe and most recently iCloud products. It later began selling third-party applications through the Mac App Store.

Newer versions of Mac OS X also included modifications to the general interface, moving away from the striped gloss and transparency of the initial versions. Some applications began to use a brushed metal appearance, or non-pinstriped title bar appearance in version 10.4.In Leopard, Apple announced a unification of the interface, with a standardized  gray-gradient window style.

<h2>Important Changes</h2>

<p class=par_main>In 2012, with the release of OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, the name of the system was shortened from Mac OS X to OS X. That year, Apple removed the head of OS X development, Scott Forstall, and design was changed towards a more minimal direction. Apple's new user interface design, using deep color saturation, text-only buttons and a minimal, 'flat' interface, was debuted with iOS 7 in 2013.


In 2016, with the release of macOS 10.12 Sierra, the name was changed from OS X to macOS to streamline it with the branding of Apple's other primary operating systems: iOS, watchOS, and tvOS. macOS 10.12 Sierra's main features are the introduction of Siri to macOS, Optimized Storage, improvements to included applications, and greater integration with Apple's iPhone and Apple Watch. The <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_File_System target=blank_>Apple File System</a> (APFS) was announced at Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June 2016 as a replacement for <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HFS%2B target=blank_>HFS+</a>, a highly criticized file system.

<h2>Apple’s Processor Architecture</h2> 

<p class=par_main>macOS has supported three major processor architectures. It first supported <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC target=blank_>PowerPC</a>-based Macs in 1999. Starting in 2006, with the Mac transition to Intel processors, it ran on Macs using Intel x86 processors. Most recently, starting in 2020, with the Mac transition to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Silicon target=blank_>Apple Silicon</a>, it runs on Macs using <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AArch64 target=blank_>64-bit ARM</a>-based <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Silicon target=blank_>Apple Silicon</a> processors.

The first release of macOS to support ARM is macOS Big Sur.
