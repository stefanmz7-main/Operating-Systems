<h1>What's an operating system?</h1>
<p class=par_main>An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.
Operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, printing, and other resources.
For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware, although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS function or is interrupted by it. Operating systems are found on many devices that contain a computer â€“ from cellular phones and video game consoles to web servers and supercomputers.</p>

<h1>Operating systems</h1>
<p class=par_main>The most common operating systems for computers are Microsoft Windows,macOS and Linux(and all its distributions-which are  differerent designs of the same operating system with  different functions but sharing one and the same core functionality). For mobile devices the main operating systems are Android and iOS.</p>
<p class=par_main>The dominant general-purpose desktop operating system is Microsoft Windows with a market share of around 76.45%. macOS by Apple Inc. is in second place (17.72%), and the varieties of Linux are collectively in third place (1.73%).
In the mobile sector (including smartphones and tablets), Android's share is up to 72% in the year 2020. According to third quarter 2016 data, Android's share on smartphones is dominant with 87.5 percent with also a growth rate of 10.3 percent per year, followed by Apple's iOS with 12.1 percent with per year decrease in market share of 5.2 percent, while other operating systems amount to just 0.3 percent.
 Linux distributions are dominant in the server and supercomputing sectors. Other specialized classes of operating systems (special-purpose operating systems), such as embedded and real-time systems, exist for many applications. Security-focused operating systems also exist. Some operating systems have low system requirements (i.e. light-weight Linux distribution). Others may have higher system requirements.
Some operating systems require installation or may come pre-installed with purchased computers (OEM-installation), whereas others may run directly from media (i.e. live cd) or flash memory (i.e. usb stick).Linux for example is an operating system that can run directly from media (a cd or usb stick).</p>

<h1>Operating System Types</h1>
<h2>Single-tasking and multi-tasking</h2>
<p class=par_main>A single-tasking system can only run one program at a time, while a multi-tasking operating system allows more than one program to be running simultaneously. This is achieved by time-sharing, where the available processor time is divided between multiple processes. These processes are each interrupted repeatedly in time slices by a task-scheduling subsystem of the operating system. Multi-tasking may be characterized in preemptive and co-operative types. 
In preemptive multitasking, the operating system slices the CPU time and dedicates a slot to each of the programs.
Cooperative multitasking is achieved by relying on each process to provide time to the other processes in a defined manner. 
Linux,for example uses preemptive multi-tasking. Older versions of Windows used cooperative multi-tasking,but newer versions use preemptive multi-tasking.</p>
<h2>Single- and multi-user</h2>
<p class=par_main>Single-user operating systems don't allow multiple users, but may allow multiple programs to run in tandem.
A multi-user operating system  permits multiple users to interact with the system at the same time.</p>
<h2>Distributed</h2>
<p class=par_main>A distributed operating system manages a group of distinct, networked computers and makes them appear to be a single computer, as all computations are distributed (divided amongst the computers).</p>
<h2>Templated</h2>
<p class=par_main>In the distributed and cloud computing context of an OS, templating refers to creating a single virtual machine image as a guest operating system, then saving it as a tool for multiple running virtual machines. 
The technique is used both in virtualization and cloud computing management, and is common in large server warehouses.</p>
<h2>Embedded</h2>
<p class=par_main>Embedded operating systems are designed to be used in embedded computer systems. They are designed to operate on small machines (e.g. PDAs).<img src=></img> 
They are very compact and extremely efficient by design, and are able to operate with a limited amount of resources. <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Embedded_Compact target=_blank> Windows CE </a>and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minix_3 target=_blank> Minix 3</a> are some examples of embedded operating systems.</p>
<h2>Real-time</h2>
<p class=par_main>A real-time operating system (RTOS) is an operating system (OS) intended to serve real-time applications that process data as it comes in, typically without buffer delays. Processing time requirements (including any OS delay) are measured in tenths of seconds or shorter increments of time. 
A real-time system is a time-bound system which has well-defined, fixed time constraints. Processing must be done within the defined constraints or the system will fail. 
They either are <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming target=_blank>event-driven</a> or <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-sharing target=_blank>time-sharing</a>. Event-driven systems switch between tasks based on their priorities, while time-sharing systems switch the task based on clock interrupts(processor clock).</p>
<h2>Library</h2>
<p class=par_main>A library operating system is one in which the services that a typical operating system provides, such as networking, are provided in the form of libraries and composed with the application and configuration code to construct a unikernel: a specialized, single address space, machine image that can be deployed to cloud or embedded environments.</p>
