<h2>Introduction to Android</h2>
<img src=1173px-Android_logo_2019.svg.png height=197px align=right style="margin-left:15px;"></img>

<p class=par_main>Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software, designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as
 smartphones and tablets. Android is developed by a consortium of developers known as the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Handset_Alliance>Open Handset Alliance</a> and commercially sponsored by Google. It was unveiled in November 2007, with the first commercial Android device launched in September 2008.


It is free and open source software; its source code is known as <a href=https://source.android.com/>Android Open Source Project</a> (AOSP).However most Android devices ship with additional proprietary software pre-installed, most notably Google Mobile Services (GMS) which includes core apps such as Google Chrome, the digital distribution platform Google Play and associated Google Play Services development platform. About 70 percent of Android smartphones run Google's ecosystem; competing Android ecosystems include <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_OS>Fire OS</a> (developed by Amazon) or <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LineageOS>LineageOS</a>. However the "Android" name and logo are trademarks of Google which impose standards to restrict "uncertified" devices outside their ecosystem to use Android branding.


The source code has been used to develop variants of Android on a range of other electronics, such as game consoles, digital cameras, portable media players, PCs and others, each with a specialized user interface. Some well known derivatives include Android TV for televisions and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wear_OS>Wear OS</a> for wearables, both developed by Google. Software packages on Android, which use the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_application_package>APK</a> format, are generally distributed through proprietary application stores like Google Play Store, Samsung Galaxy Store, and Huawei AppGallery, or open source platforms like <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aptoide>Aptoide</a> or <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-Droid>F-Droid</a>.



Android has been the best-selling OS worldwide on smartphones since 2011 and on tablets since 2013. As of May 2017, it has over two billion monthly active users, the largest installed base of any operating system, and as of January 2021, the Google Play Store features over 3 million apps.The current stable version is Android 11, released on September 8, 2020.

<h2>History</h2>
<p class=par_main>Android Inc. was founded in Palo Alto, California, in October 2003 by Andy Rubin, Rich Miner, Nick Sears, and Chris White.Rubin described the Android project as having "tremendous potential in developing smarter mobile devices that are more aware of its owner's location and preferences". The early intentions of the company were to develop an advanced operating system for digital cameras, and this was the basis of its pitch to investors in April 2004. The company then decided that the market for cameras was not large enough for its goals, and five months later it had diverted its efforts and was pitching Android as a handset operating system that would rival <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbian>Symbian</a> and Microsoft <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Mobile>Windows Mobile</a>.



In July 2005,Google acquired Android Inc. for at least $50 million. Its key employees, including Rubin, Miner, Sears, and White, joined Google as part of the acquisition. Not much was known about the secretive Android Inc. at the time, with the company having provided few details other than that it was making software for mobile phones. At Google, the team led by Rubin developed a mobile device platform powered by the Linux kernel. Google marketed the platform to handset makers and carriers on the promise of providing a flexible, upgradeable system.


Speculation about Google's intention to enter the mobile communications market continued to build through December 2006.An early prototype had a close resemblance to a BlackBerry phone, with no touchscreen and a physical QWERTY keyboard, but the arrival of 2007's Apple iPhone meant that Android "had to go back to the drawing board".


The first commercially available smartphone running Android was the HTC Dream, also known as T-Mobile G1, announced on September 23, 2008. </p> <div align=center><figure><img src=524250272.jpg.0.jpg><figcaption class=caption align=center >Andy Rubin,the creator of Android</figcaption></figure></div><div style="margin-top:200px;"><h2>The Desserts</h2><p class=par_main>Since 2008, Android has seen numerous updates which have incrementally improved the operating system, adding new features and fixing bugs in previous releases. Each major release is named in alphabetical order after a dessert or sugary treat, with the first few Android versions being called "Cupcake", "Donut", "Eclair", and "Froyo", in that order. 

After Oreo Google  stopped using dessert names and just used version numbers.

On August 22, 2019, it was announced that Android "Q" would officially be branded as Android 10, ending the historic practice of naming major versions after desserts. Google stated that these names were not "inclusive" to international users (due either to the aforementioned foods not being internationally known, or being difficult to pronounce in some languages). On the same day, Android Police reported that Google had commissioned a statue of a giant number "10" to be installed in the lobby of the developers' new office. Android 10 was released on September 3, 2019 to Google Pixel phones first.Here’s a list of all Android versions with dessert names:
<list>
	<li>Android 1.5 Cupcake </li>
	<li>Android 1.6 Donut</li>
	<li>Android 2.0 Eclair</li>
	<li>Android 2.2 Froyo</li>
	<li>Android 2.3 GingerBread</li>
	<li>Android 3.0 Honeycomb</li>
	<li>Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich</li>
	<li>Android 4.1 Jelly Bean</li>
	<li>Android 4.4 KitKat</li>
	<li>Android 5.0 Lollipop</li>
	<li>Android 6.0 Marshmallow</li>
	<li>Android 7.0 Nougat</li>
	<li>Android 8.0 Oreo</li>
	<li>Android 9 Pie</li>
</list>

<h2>Important Events for Google</h2>
<p class=par_main>In 2010, Google launched its Nexus series of devices, a lineup in which Google partnered with different device manufacturers to produce new devices and introduce new Android versions. The series was described as having "played a pivotal role in Android's history by introducing new software iterations and hardware standards across the board", and became known for its "bloat-free" software with "timely ... updates". At its developer conference in May 2013, Google announced a special version of the Samsung Galaxy S4, where, instead of using Samsung's own Android customization, the phone ran "stock Android" and was promised to receive new system updates fast.The device would become the start of the Google Play edition program, and was followed by other devices, including the HTC One Google Play edition, and Moto G Google Play edition.</p>
<p class=par_main>In 2013
Google's then-CEO Larry Page announced in a blog post that Andy Rubin had moved from the Android division to take on new projects at Google, and that Sundar Pichai would become the new Android lead

In June 2014, Google announced <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_One>Android One</a>, a set of "hardware reference models" that would "allow device makers to easily create high-quality phones at low costs", designed for consumers in developing countries.In September, Google announced the first set of Android One phones for release in India.

Google introduced the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones in October 2016, marketed as being the first phones made by Google, and exclusively featured certain software features, such as the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Assistant>Google Assistant</a>, before wider rollout. The Pixel phones replaced the Nexus series, with a new generation of Pixel phones launched in October 2017.

In May 2019, the operating system became entangled in the trade war between China and the United States involving Huawei, which, like many other tech firms, had become dependent on access to the Android platform. In the summer of 2019, Huawei announced it would create an alternative operating system to Android known as <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony_OS>Harmony OS</a>,and has filed for intellectual property rights across major global markets.Huawei does not currently have any plans to replace Android in the near future, as Harmony OS is designed for internet of things devices, rather than for smartphones.

	<h2>User Interface and Apps</h2>
	    <img src=GooglePlay.png height=200px align =right style="margin-left:15px;"></img>

	<p class=par_main>Android's default user interface is mainly based on direct manipulation, using touch inputs that loosely correspond to real-world actions, like swiping, tapping, pinching, and reverse pinching to manipulate  on-screen objects, along with a virtual keyboard. Game controllers and full-size physical keyboards are supported via Bluetooth or USB.The response to user input is designed to be immediate and provides a fluid touch interface, often using the vibration capabilities of the device to provide haptic feedback to the user. Internal hardware, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and proximity sensors are used by some applications to respond to additional user actions, for example adjusting the screen from portrait to landscape depending on how the device is oriented,or allowing the user to steer a vehicle in a racing game by rotating the device, simulating control of a steering wheel
		Many, to almost all, Android devices come with preinstalled Google apps including Gmail, Google Maps, Google Chrome, YouTube, Google Play Music, Google Play Movies & TV, and many more. You can download third-party apps form the Google Play Store.

		Due to the open nature of Android, a number of third-party application marketplaces also exist for Android, either to provide a substitute for devices that are not allowed to ship with Google Play Store, provide applications that cannot be offered on Google Play Store due to policy violations, or for other reasons. Examples of these third-party stores have included the Amazon Appstore, GetJar, and SlideMe. F-Droid, another alternative marketplace, seeks to only provide appli-cations that are distributed under free and open source licenses.

		In October 2020, Google removed several Android applications from Play Store, as they were identified breaching its data collection rules

<h2>Hardware and Distribution</h2>
<p class=par_main>
The main hardware platform for Android is ARM (the ARMv7 and ARMv8-A architectures), with x86 and x86-64 architectures also officially supported in later versions of Android.

Android is developed by Google until the latest changes and updates are ready to be released, at which point the source code is made available to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP),an open source initiative led by Google.The AOSP code can be found without modification on select devices, mainly the former Nexus and current Android One series of devices.

The source code is, in turn, customized by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to run on their hardware.Android's source code does not contain the device drivers, often proprietary, that are needed for certain hardware components. As a result, most Android devices, including Google's own, ship with a combination of free and open source and proprietary software.
