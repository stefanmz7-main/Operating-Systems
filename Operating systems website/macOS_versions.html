<h2>Mac OS X 10.0 (Cheetah)</h2>
<p class=par_main>On March 24, 2001, Apple released Mac OS X 10.0 (internally codenamed Cheetah). The initial version was slow,incomplete,and had very few applications available at launch, mostly from independent developers. While many critics suggested that the operating system was not ready for mainstream adoption, they recognized the importance of its initial launch as a base on which to improve.Simply releasing Mac OS X was received by the Macintosh community as a great accomplishment,for attempts to overhaul the Mac OS had been underway since 1996, and delayed by countless setbacks.</p>

<h2>Mac OS X 10.1 (Puma)</h2>
<p class=par_main>Later that year on September 25, 2001, Mac OS X 10.1 (internally codenamed Puma) was released. It featured increased performance and provided missing features, such as DVD playback.
On January 7, 2002, Apple announced that Mac OS X was to be the default operating system for all Macintosh products by the end of that month.
</p>
<h2>Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar</h2>
<p class=par_main>On August 23, 2002,Apple followed up with Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar, the first release to use its code name as part of the branding.It brought great raw performance improvements, a sleeker look, and many powerful user-interface enhancements (over 150, according to Apple ), including <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz_Compositor target=blank_>Quartz Extreme</a> for compositing graphics directly on an ATI Radeon or Nvidia GeForce2 MX graphics card with at least 16 MB of VRAM, a system-wide repository for <br>contact information in the new Address Book, and an instant messaging client named iChat. The Happy Mac which had appeared during the Mac OS startup sequence for almost 18 years was replaced with a large grey Apple logo <br>with the introduction of Mac OS X v10.2.
</p>
<h2>Mac OS X 10.3 Panther</h2>
<p class=par_main>Mac OS X v10.3 Panther was released on October 24, 2003. It significantly improved performance and incorporated the most extensive update yet to the user interface. Panther included as many or more new features as Jaguar had <br>the year before, including an updated Finder, incorporating a brushed-metal interface, Fast user switching, Exposé (Window manager), FileVault, Safari, iChat AV (which added video conferencing features to iChat), improved Portable Document Format (PDF) rendering and much greater Microsoft Windows interoperability. Support for some early G3 computers such as "beige" Power Macs and "WallStreet" PowerBooks was discontinued.

<h2>Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger</h2>
<p class=par_main>Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger was released on April 29, 2005. Apple stated that Tiger contained more than 200 new features. As with Panther, certain older machines were no longer supported; Tiger requires a Mac with 256 MB and a built-in FireWire port. Among the new features, Tiger introduced <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotlight_(software) target=blank_>Spotlight</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_(Mac_OS) target=blank_>Dashboard</a>, Smart Folders, updated Mail program with Smart Mailboxes, QuickTime 7, Safari 2, Automator, VoiceOver, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_Image target=blank_>Core Image</a> and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_Video target=blank_>Core Video</a>. 

On January 10, 2006, Apple released the first Intel-based Macs along with the 10.4.4 update to Tiger. This operating system functioned identically on the PowerPC-based Macs and the new Intel-based machines, with the exception of the Intel release lacking support for the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Environment target=blank_>Classic Environment</a>.
</p>
<h2>Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard</h2>
<p class=par_main>Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard was released on October 26, 2007. It was called by Apple "the largest update of Mac OS X". It brought more than 300 new features. Leopard supports both <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC target=blank_>PowerPC</a>- and Intel x86-based Macintosh computers. New features include a new look, an updated Finder, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Machine_(macOS) target=blank_>Time Machine</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaces_(software) target=blank_>Spaces</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boot_Camp_(software) target=blank_>Boot Camp</a> pre-installed,[206] full support for 64-bit applications (including graphical applications), new features in Mail and iChat, and a number of new security features.
 Leopard dropped support for the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Environment target=blank_>Classic Environment</a> and all Classic applications. It was the final version of Mac OS X to support the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC target=blank_>PowerPC</a> architecture.

<h2>Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard</h2>
<p class=par_main>Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard was released on August 28, 2009. Rather than delivering big changes to the appearance and end user functionality like the previous releases of Mac OS X, Snow Leopard focused on "under the hood" changes, increasing the performance, efficiency, and stability of the operating system. For most users, the most noticeable changes were: the disk space that the operating system frees up after a clean install compared to Mac OS X<br> 10.5 Leopard, a more responsive Finder rewritten in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocoa_(API) target=blank_>Cocoa</a>, faster <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Machine_(macOS) target=blank_>Time Machine</a> backups, more reliable and user-friendly disk ejects, a more powerful version of the Preview application, as well as a faster Safari web browser. 

Snow Leopard only supported machines with Intel CPUs, required at least 1 GB of RAM, and dropped default support for applications built for the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC target=blank_>PowerPC</a>architecture 

Snow Leopard also featured new 64-bit technology capable of supporting greater amounts of RAM, improved support for multi-core processors and advanced GPU performance with <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCL target=blank_>OpenCL</a>.

The 10.6.6 update introduced support for the Mac App Store, Apple's digital distribution platform for macOS applications.</p>
<h2>Mac OS X 10.7 Lion</h2>
<p class=par_main>Mac OS X 10.7 Lion was released on July 20, 2011. It brought developments made in Apple's iOS, such as an easily navigable display of installed applications called Launchpad and a greater use of multi-touch gestures, to the Mac. 
Changes made to the GUI include auto-hiding scrollbars that only appear when they are used, and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Control_(macOS) target=blank_>Mission Control</a> which unifies Exposé, Spaces, Dashboard, and full-screen applications within a single interface. Apple also made changes to applications: they resume in the same state as they were before they were closed, similar to iOS. Documents auto-save by default.

<h2>OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion</h2>
<p class=par_main>OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion was released on July 25, 2012.

It incorporates some features seen in iOS 5, which include Game Center, support for <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMessage target=blank_>iMessage</a> in the new Messages messaging application, and Reminders as a to-do list app separate from iCal (which is renamed as Calendar, like the iOS app). It also includes support for storing <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IWork target=blank_>iWork</a> documents in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICloud target=blank_>iCloud</a>. Notification Center, which makes its debut in Mountain Lion, is a desktop version similar to the one in iOS 5.0 and higher. Application pop-ups are now concentrated on the corner of the screen, and the Center itself is pulled from the right side of the screen. Mountain Lion also includes more Chinese features including support for <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baidu target=blank_>Baidu</a> as an option for Safari search engine.

Starting with Mountain Lion, Apple software updates (including the OS) are distributed via the App Store.This updating mechanism replaced the Apple Software Update utility.

<h2>OS X 10.9 Mavericks</h2>
<p class=par_main>OS X 10.9 Mavericks was released on October 22, 2013. It was a free upgrade to all users running Snow Leopard or later with a 64-bit Intel processor.

<h2>OS X 10.10 Yosemite</h2>
<p class=par_main>OS X 10.10 Yosemite was released on October 16, 2014. It features a redesigned user interface similar to that of iOS 7, intended to feature a more minimal, text-based 'flat' design, with use of translucency effects and intensely saturated colors. Apple's showcase new feature in Yosemite is Handoff, which enables users with iPhones running iOS 8.1 or later to answer phone calls, receive and send SMS messages, and complete unfinished iPhone emails<br> on their Mac. As of OS X 10.10.3, Photos replaced iPhoto and Aperture.

<h2>OS X 10.11 El Capitan</h2>
<p class=par_main>OS X 10.11 El Capitan was released on September 30, 2015. Similar to Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, Apple described this release as emphasizing "refinements to the Mac experience" and "improvements to system performance". Refinements include public transport built into the Maps application, GUI improvements to the Notes application, adopting San Francisco as the system font for clearer legibility, and the introduction of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Integrity_Protection target=blank_>System Integrity Protection</a>.
<br>The <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_(API) target=blank_>Metal API</a>, first introduced in iOS 8, was also included in this operating system for "all Macs since 2012".According to Apple, Metal accelerates system-level rendering by up to 50 percent, resulting in faster graphics performance for everyday apps. Metal also delivers up to 10 times faster draw call performance for more fluid experience in games and pro apps.
