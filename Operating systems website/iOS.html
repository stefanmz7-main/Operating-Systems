<h2>What is iOS?</h2>
	<p class=par_main>iOS (formerly iPhone OS) is a mobile operating system created and developed by Apple Inc. exclusively for its hardware.<br> It is the operating system that powers many of the company's mobile devices, &nbsp;including the iPhone and iPod Touch. The<br> term also included the versions running on iPads until the name <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS>iPadOS</a> was introduced with iOS 13 in 2019. &nbsp;iOS is &nbsp;the<br> world's second-most widely installed mobile operating system, after Android. It is the basis for Apple's three other operating<br> systems: <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS>iPadOS</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TvOS>tvOS</a>, and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WatchOS>watchOS</a>. It is proprietary software, although some parts of it are open source under the Apple<br> Public Source License and other licenses.Unveiled in 2007 for the first-generation iPhone, iOS has since been extended to<br> support other Apple devices like the iPod Touch (September 2007) and the iPad (January 2010). As of March 2018, Apple's<br> App Store contains more than 2.1 million iOS applications, 1 million of which are native for iPads. These mobile apps have<br> collectively been downloaded more than 130 billion times.


		Major versions of iOS are being released annually. &nbsp;The current<br> stable version, iOS 14, was released to the public on September 16, 2020. It brought many user interface changes, &nbsp;inclu-<br>ding the ability to place widgets on the home screen, a compact UI for both Siri and phone calls, and the ability to change<br> both the default web browser and email apps. All devices which are supported by iOS 13 are able to run iOS 14.

<h2>History</h2>
<p class=par_main>In 2005, when Steve Jobs began planning the iPhone, he had a choice to either "shrink the Mac, which would be an epic feat of engineering, or enlarge the iPod". Jobs favored the former approach but pitted the Macintosh and iPod teams, led by Scott Forstall and Tony Fadell, respectively, against each other in an internal competition, with Forstall winning by creating the iPhone OS. The decision enabled the success of the iPhone as a platform for third-party developers: using a well-known desktop operating system as its basis allowed the many third-party Mac developers to write software for the iPhone with minimal retraining. Forstall was also responsible for creating a software development kit for programmers to build iPhone apps, as well as an App Store within <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes>iTunes</a>.

The operating system was unveiled with the iPhone at the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macworld_Conference_%26_Expo>Macworld Conference & Expo</a> on January 9, 2007, and released in June of that year. At the time of its unveiling in January, Steve Jobs claimed: "iPhone runs OS X" and runs "desktop class applications",but at the time of the iPhone's release, the operating system was renamed "iPhone OS".Initially, third-party native applications were not supported. Jobs' reasoning was that developers could build web applications through the Safari web browser that "would behave like native apps on the iPhone".In October 2007, Apple announced that a native Software Development Kit (SDK) was under development and that they planned to put it "in developers' hands in February". On March 6, 2008, Apple held a press event, announcing the iPhone SDK.

<h3>The App Store</h3>
<p class=par_main>The iOS App Store was opened on July 10, 2008 with an initial 500 applications available.This quickly grew to 3,000 in September 2008, 15,000 in January 2009,50,000 in June 2009, 250,000 in August 2010,650,000 in July 2012, 2 million in June 2016 and 2.2 million in January 2017. As of now,2021 the Apple App Store has 1.96 million apps available for download. As of March 2016, 1 million apps are natively compatible with the iPad tablet computer.These apps have collectively been downloaded more than 130 billion times.

<h2>Important Events for Apple</h2>
<p class=par_main>In June 2010, Apple rebranded iPhone OS as "iOS". The trademark "IOS" had been used by Cisco for over a decade for its operating system, IOS, used on its routers. To avoid any potential lawsuit, Apple licensed the "IOS" trademark from Cisco.
In October 2016, Apple opened its first iOS Developer Academy in Naples inside University of Naples Federico II's new campus.The course is completely free, aimed at acquiring specific technical skills on the creation and management of applications for the Apple ecosystem platforms.At the Academy there are also issues of business administration (business planning and business management with a focus on digital opportunities) and there is a path dedicated to the design of graphical interfaces.


On June 3, 2019, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS>iPadOS</a> , the branded version of iOS for iPad, was announced at the 2019 WWDC; it was launched on September 25, 2019.

<div style="transform:translate(0px,90px);margin-top:50px;">
<h2>User Interface and Apps</h2>
<p class=par_main>The iOS user interface is based upon direct manipulation, using multi-touch gestures such as swipe, tap, pinch, and reverse pinch. Interface control elements include sliders, switches, and buttons.Internal accelerometers are used by some applications to respond to shaking the device (one common result is the undo command) or rotating it in three dimensions (one common result is switching between portrait and landscape mode). Various accessibility functions enable users with vision and hearing disabilities to properly use iOS.


iOS devices come with preinstalled apps developed by Apple including Mail, Maps, TV, Music, FaceTime, Wallet, Health, and many more. You can download third party apps only from the App Store,external sources are not allowed.



Multitasking for iOS was first released in June 2010 along with the release of iOS 4.Only certain devices—iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, and iPod Touch 3rd generation—were able to multitask.The iPad did not get multitasking until iOS 4.2.1 in that November.


In iOS 7, Apple introduced a new multitasking feature, providing all apps with the ability to perform background updates. This feature prefers to update the user's most frequently used apps.

<h2>Siri</h2>
<p class=par_main>Siri is an intelligent personal assistant integrated into iOS. Siri is part of Apple Inc.'s iOS,<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS>iPadOS</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WatchOS>watchOS</a>, macOS, and  <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TvOS>tvOS</a> operating systems. Originally released as an app for iOS in February 2010,it was acquired by Apple two months later,and then integrated into iPhone 4S at its release in October 2011.At that time, the separate app was also removed from the iOS App Store.The assistant uses voice queries, gesture based control, focus-tracking and a natural-language user interface to answer questions, make recommendations, and perform actions by delegating requests to a set of Internet services. The software adapts to users' individual language usages, searches, and preferences, with continuing use. Returned results are individualized.
Siri supports a wide range of user commands, including performing phone actions, checking basic information, scheduling events and reminders, handling device settings, searching the Internet, navigating areas, finding information on entertainment, and is able to engage with iOS-integrated apps. With the release of iOS 10 in 2016, Apple opened up limited third-party access to Siri, including third-party messaging apps, as well as payments, ride-sharing, and Internet calling apps. With the release of iOS 11, Apple updated Siri's voices for more clear, human voices, started supporting follow-up questions and language translation, and additional third-party actions.

<h3>Development of Siri</h3>
<p class=par_main>
Siri is a spin-off from a project originally developed by the SRI International Artificial Intelligence Center. Its speech recognition engine was provided by Nuance Communications, and Siri uses advanced machine learning technologies to function. Its original American, British, and Australian voice actors recorded their respective voices around 2005, unaware of recordings' eventual usage in Siri. 
</p>
</div>
<div style="transform:translate(0px,190px);">
<h3>Voices of Siri</h3>
<p class=par_main>The original American voice of Siri was provided in July 2005 by Susan Bennett, unaware that it would eventually be used for the voice assistant

The original British male voice was provided by Jon Briggs, a former technology journalist.

The original Australian voice was provided by Karen Jacobsen, a voice-over artist known in Australia for her work as the GPS girl.

As part of an interview between all three voice actors and The Guardian, Briggs stated that "the original system was recorded for a US company called Scansoft, who were then bought by Nuance. Apple simply licensed it."

With iOS 11, Apple auditioned hundreds of candidates to find new female voices and then recorded several hours of speech, including different personalities and expressions, to build a new text-to-speech voice based on deep learning technology.</p>

<h2>Hardware used for iOS</h2>
<p class=par_main>The main hardware platform for iOS is the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture>ARM architecture</a>. iOS releases before iOS 7 can only be run on iOS devices with 32-bit ARM processors. In 2013, iOS 7 was released with full 64-bit support with the introduction of the Apple A7 chip. 64-bit support was also enforced for all apps in the App Store; All new apps submitted to the App Store with a deadline of February 2015, and all app updates submitted to the App Store with a deadline of June 1, 2015. iOS 11 drops support for all iOS devices with 32-bit ARM processors as well as 32-bit applications,making iOS 64-bit only.</p>
